# Star Wars: Darth Vader - Text-Based RPG

A choice-driven tactical RPG following Darth Vader's journey between Episodes III and IV. Inspired by KOTOR, Force Unleashed, and Oregon Trail's consequence-driven gameplay.

## 🎮 Project Overview

Play as Darth Vader during the Dark Times, hunting Jedi, serving the Emperor, and forging your own path to power. Every choice matters - from how you upgrade your suit to how you execute your enemies.

### Key Features

- **Choice-Driven Narrative**: Your decisions shape Vader's darkness, relationships, and the story
- **Suit Upgrade System**: Upgrade across 5 tiers, but upgrade too fast and Palpatine will test your loyalty
- **Force Powers**: From basic Push/Pull to legendary abilities like Force Lightning and Devastation
- **Tactical Turn-Based Combat**: KOTOR-style combat with Force Point management and enemy AI
- **Psychological Tracking**: Darkness, Control, Rage, and Suppression affect abilities and story
- **Consequence System**: Choices ripple through the story, affecting missions, relationships, and endings
